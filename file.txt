Alexandra's favourite Alestorm Songs:

Song 1: Fucked with an Anchor;  Album: No Grave but the Sea;  Why: The lyrics are funny and I love the melody.  

Song 2: You are a Pirate;  Album: Back Through Time;  Why: Two main reasons: 1) Alestorm are a pirate metal band and this song is about being a pirate; and 2) Stefán Karl Stefánsson will always be number one.  

Song 3: In the Navy;  Album: Live at the End of the World;  Why: 1) It's a Village People song, enough said.  

Song 4: Pegleg Potion for Dogs;  Album: No Grave but the Sea;  Why: Dogs.
